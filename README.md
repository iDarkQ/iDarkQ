## Hi there, I'm iDarkQ (Łukasz) 👋

Hi! I am an 18-year-old programmer from 🇵🇱 Poland, currently living in 🇵🇹 Portugal. The technologies I currently focus on include ⚡ Fastify and ⚛️ React. In total, I have over 5 years of programming experience in over 8 languages including 🟦 TypeScript, ☕ Java, 🐘 PHP, 🎯 Dart, 🧃 Kotlin, and 💠 C#.

🚀 Currently, I am the co-owner of **[Better Bedrock](https://betterbedrock.com)**, endeavoring to expand our community by simplifying accessibility to favorite and most-used functions and improving users' gaming experience 🎮.

I also created **[Daylytic.com](https://daylytic.com)** 🧠, a platform helping people reach their potential 🌟.

I am a fast learner, always eager to grow and expand my horizons. I speak 3 languages: 🇵🇱 Polish, 🇬🇧 English, and I'm still learning 🇵🇹 Portuguese. 

If you'd like to collaborate and build something awesome together, feel free to reach out!
